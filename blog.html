            <h2 class="heading-2">True Freedom in Christ</h2>
            <img class="freedom" src="img/freedom.jpg" alt="freedom">
            <p class="para">Hello everyone! This is my first blog so I hope you enjoy it. My thoughts that went into this blog just flooded me the morning of the Fourth of July and I feel that the Holy Spirit was giving me a nudge to share what He has shown me. I’m sorry it has taken so long. Being a busy dad and employed full-time doesn’t always give me time to do the things I want. </p>

            <p class="para">On the Fourth of July, I read that day’s gospel reading and went for a walk and prayed my rosary. As I was walking and praying it struck me that that day being the 4th of July in the United States we are celebrating freedom from a foreign power. The gospel reading also ties into in a theme of freeing us from a foreign power; namely sin and Satan.</p>

            <p class="para">So, what’s the gospel reading for the Fourth of July 2019 you might be asking? I’m glad you asked! It is from the book of Matthew, Chapter 9, versus 1 through 8:</p>

            <p id="quote">“And climbing into a boat, he [Jesus] crossed the sea, and he arrived at his own city. And behold, they brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And Jesus seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, ‘Be strengthened in faith son; your sins are forgiven you.’ And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves, ‘He is blaspheming.’ And when Jesus had perceived their thoughts, he said, ‘Why do you think such evil in your hearts? Which do you think is easier to say, “Your sins are forgiven you” or to say, “Rise up and walk?” But, so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins,’ he then said to the paralytic, ‘Rise up, take your bed, and go into your house.’ And he arose and went into his house. Then the crowd, seeing this, was frightened, and they glorified God, who gave such power to men.”</p>

            <p class="para">Jesus came into the world to free us. Free us from what? He came to free us from the bondage of sin; both sin of the world and personal sin - that is to say my sins, your sins, and our collective sins. People get all upset when the Catholic Church says don’t do this and don’t do that. But, have you ever really thought why the Church is making those statements? Is the Church just trying to control people through fear and ignorance or is there something more to it than that? In truth, the Church does not seek to control or manipulate people or make people afraid of God. What the Church is trying to do is to give people true freedom.</p>

            <p class="para">So, you might be thinking to yourself, what are some concrete examples? Demonstrate to me not just in theory but in practicality how deviating from Church teaching can lead to bondage in sin, or even unhealthy attachments to things. All right…hold onto your hats; here we go!</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 1: </strong>A girlfriend and boyfriend of high school or college age start to have sex. They have freedom and are using their bodies in a way that is pleasing to them. Everything is great until the day…you know the day…the day when the girl gets up in the morning and doesn’t feel too well. She stumbles to the bathroom and throws up. In the next month, she misses her period and after taking a pregnancy test to her and her boyfriend’s shock they find out she is pregnant. Where is her freedom now? Where is his freedom now? They both feel trapped.</p>

            <p class="para">If they were to remain chaste like Holy Mother Church has recommended, this girl and boy would still be free. But now, they are faced with two choices that no one should ever have to make: Choice 1) Have the baby and have their futures they had dreamed of put into serious doubt, or 2) have an abortion, which sounds like freedom until you find out that many women deal with emotional issues (and some physical complications like becoming infertile) for the rest of their life. Either way, this girl’s life and this boy’s life will forever be changed, and the freedom they once had is gone either physically, emotionally or both.</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 2: </strong>A woman is married and has children.  The woman is not happy with her marriage (people are usually not happy with themselves and project that unhappiness onto their spouse and blame them) and through chance, she meets someone else and begins having an affair. The affair goes on for a while until her husband finds out…the spouse always finds out sooner or later because secrets are hard to keep for very long. Someone always spills the beans while drinking with friends or the wife will leave her cell phone unlocked and a message pops up that catches her husband’s eye.</p>

            <p class="para">You know the drill. Soon, words are spoken, and trust has been destroyed. A divorce is looming in the horizon. The husband moves out and the children become the real victims in this tragedy. Because of the sin of adultery of the wife (the husband may have some culpability too) a whole family is destroyed in the process. If the wife had listened and taken to heart the teachings of Church the resultant devastation of her actions would never had happened. She instead would have spoken to her husband about her feelings and they could have gone to counseling and even seen a priest for help. Likewise, if the husband had listened to the Church, he would have loved his wife as Christ loved the Church and been the kind of husband she needed to begin with.</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 3: </strong>A young woman really enjoys drinking with her friends. She feels that when she drinks she is free to be herself.  She starts drinking too much on the weekends and soon those weekends start getting longer and longer until those weekends last almost the whole week. She’s drinking every night after work and is soon introduced into the wonderful world of cocaine by a friend and starts snorting the white stuff on Saturdays; and soon on Sundays too. She soon becomes addicted and cannot stop drinking or snorting cocaine. She is now a slave to alcohol and cocaine. They call her name day and night. She must answer the call because not answering will result in bad headaches and feeling severely ill. She has lost her freedom. If it continues she will lose her job, possibly her family, and at worse; her life. If she had listened to the Church and understood that her body was the temple of the Holy Spirit she would not have abused it.</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 4: </strong>You are a man who considers himself bisexual. You have only dated and had sex with women in the past, but that is getting old. You seek more excitement and variety. Soon you find yourself at gay bars meeting other men and hooking up with them. Times are good and you are making plenty of friends and having plenty of sexual encounters, but you are never completely satisfied. You take more chances by having riskier sexual encounters with both men and women. Sometimes you use condoms and other times you don’t. After all, using condoms can be a kill joy and the experience is what is most important.</p>

            <p class="para">A few years later, you start experiencing some weight loss, but think to yourself, "I must be doing something right with my diet and the gym." But, you keep dropping weight. Soon you start seeing sores on your mouth and you feel really tired all the time. You start applying lip balm to your lips and keep drinking coffee, but it doesn’t help. Then you get bouts of diarrhea that lasts more than week at a time. This last symptom is just too much to handle and you see a doctor. After asking you a series of questions the doctor gives you an order for a blood test. A few days later you get a call to come to the doctor’s office, and when the doctor walks in she looks a little nervous. She sits down across from you and says, “I’m sorry to inform you, but you have tested positive for HIV.” Your heart seems to skip a beat and you ask for the doctor to repeat what she just said, and you just sit there in shock as if the world just stopped. You can’t believe it. You say to yourself, “This wasn’t supposed to happen to me. This is what happens to other people.” </p>

            <p class="para">Growing up, you heard that the Catholic Church was against sex outside of marriage and you thought that those saying this were just sexually repressed grumpy old men who sought to scare and control their “flock” to fleece them. Now, after getting this terminal diagnosis, you think to yourself, “Maybe they were just trying to protect me against this very thing that is consuming me.”</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 5: </strong>You are a diocesan priest at a local parish. Ever since you were young, you always felt different and you were not like the other boys. When you got older, you found yourself attracted to other boys and older men. When you got older you made a decision to enter the seminary. You became a priest because you have always wanted to help others and by becoming a priest you would no longer get pestered by your parents and aunts asking why you didn’t have a girlfriend. As time goes on, the time you spend in front of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament decreases and your prayers become dry. The last time you went to confession was over four months ago and saying Mass has become a chore.</p>

            <p class="para">As time goes on, you start surfing the net instead of praying the rosary and you eventually stumble on a gay porn website. You find it exciting and say to yourself, “No one is getting hurt, and so what’s the harm?” As the weeks go on, your time on the Internet looking at porn increases to the point that you are only getting a few hours of sleep at night. You feel exhausted and out of sorts. You start to feel your life unraveling and your ordination to the priesthood a mistake. One day you confide your feelings to another priest friend who you think feels the same way. The next thing you know both of you become very close and before long you are having sex with each other. You begin drinking and taking drugs in a futile attempt to mask the pain, confusion, anger, sadness, shame, and anxiety you feel.</p>

            <p class="para">As the months go on, you get introduced to a wider circle of priest friends who are also like-minded. You begin having sex with some of them as well while vacationing. One time, you even had sex with a teenager who told you he was an altar server while at a party. You have stopped praying all together and have not gone to confession in over a year now. You feel that you are living a double-life and start to seriously doubt what the Catholic Church teaches; this is especially true what it teaches about homosexuality. Even during your homilies you stop mentioning anything about sin because you are not even sure if sin is even real. You start feeling uncomfortable being behind the altar saying the prayers of consecration over the gifts of bread and wine and your belief in the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist begins to seriously erode.</p>

            <p class="para">Months later while you are in the rectory you hear the doorbell ring and you find two police officers at the door. They ask for your name, and once you give it to them they tell you that you are being arrested for statutory rape of a minor. You then remember the teenage altar boy you had sex with at the party. You knew you should not have had sex with him, but you got caught up in the moment. Your life flashes before your eyes and you know that the choices you have made have led to this. It is then that a quote from scripture comes into mind, “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other.” If this priest had lived the teachings of the Church, none of this would have happened.</p>

            <p class="para">You might be thinking to yourself…these are extreme examples. Sure, they happen, but what about the vast majorities of people who don’t follow what the Church teaches and are perfectly fine? Well…let’s delve into that line of thinking.</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 6: </strong>You just bought yourself the new Android smart phone (sorry iPhone lovers). It has all the coolest features in it and you really enjoy catching up with distant friends on Facebook. Soon you keep finding yourself drawn to that cell phone while sitting down doing nothing, and then in between meetings at work. Over time, you find yourself looking at your phone while your kids are trying to talk to you and just answer, “Uh ha” when they say something. When your phone buzzes or beeps you stop conversations to look at the newest news or message. Your kids stop coming to you to ask questions because now you just ignore them, as you are caught up with your tech.</p>

            <p class="para">A few years later you buy your children their own smart phones because you want them to be more independent. After all, everyone has one. Soon afterwards though, you see your kids glued to their phones too. They don’t want to eat dinner with you anymore and stay up way past their bedtimes surfing the Internet and playing online games. You get upset seeing this, and say to yourself, “It looks like my kids are addicted to their phone, but not me. I’ll show them how to live in moderation.”</p>

            <p class="para">You say to yourself, “I can put this down anytime I want.” So you do…for five minutes. You start fidgeting and say to yourself, “I’ll just check the weather…no harm in that,” and bam…you find yourself surfing the net again. You, my friend, are addicted! You are not free anymore. Your cell phone has become your new drug and you crave it and can’t live without it and like a crack dealer, you even got your kids hooked on the tech. It has become more than a drug for you; it has become your god. You worship it and it controls what and when you do anything else. You can’t even leave it on a table without it in your hand. </p>

            <p class="para">Your relationship with your kids turns into just grunts of acknowledgement now. Everyone in your family just looks into a screen instead of into each other’s eyes. Meals are eaten alone and no one talks with each other anymore…your family is now a virtual family coming apart at the seams. If you listened to what the Church taught and took her teachings seriously you would know that anything, including technology, can become a god that can take the place of the One True and Ever-living God, the one who wants to give you life to the fullest.</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 7: </strong>You are poor, and struggle all the time to make ends meet. Your thought of finding new ways to make money is constantly on your mind and is a priority. It is pretty much the only thing that is on your mind and it consumes you. You always complain about not having enough money and how life is not fair. Over the years, the desire for money becomes intense. Your desire for money has now become your god and you are no longer free because all your decisions and all your thoughts revolve around money. Everything you do is for money or because of money, even your interactions with your family and friends now. One day you see your friends’ wallet on a table and you open it. There inside you see a hundred dollars in cash. You become envious and say to yourself, “I’ll just take fifty dollars. He won’t miss it anyways. And if he does, so what, he has plenty to spare.” Your friend finds out and tells you to get out of his apartment. You get mad at him and blame him and then leave his apartment in anger.</p>

            <p class="para">You become miserable and irritable and your love for life has been lost. If you knew that the love of money is the root of all evil, you would have done your best to not let yourself become sucked into worshipping something that would instead enslave you and make you all the more poorer.</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 8: </strong>You work in Corporate America, and you want to climb the corporate ladder. You are not satisfied with your entry-level position and want to get promoted quickly. You start working late at night to show management that you are dedicated. Then you start taking on extra projects and begin working on weekends and your whole life begins to be consumed by your work. You think of nothing but work and how you can get noticed. Your whole life becomes absorbed with making a name for yourself and making more money.</p>

            <p class="para">Your career has become everything to you. Your office has become your altar that you offer to the gods of progress and success. You pass on opportunities to spend time with your family and friends and you start to alienate yourself from those who love you. When you do go out with them, you are constantly on your phone checking emails and responding to them. This bothers you a little, but you rationalize that sacrifices have to be made for your future. Before you know it, family and friends call you less to do things together. Sure you have “friends” at work, but they just go for drinks with you after work, but then go home to their families afterwards.</p>

            <p class="para">You are not free. You have wed yourself to your work and it consumes you. The humility and gratefulness you once had has been replaced by pride and arrogance. People at work are no longer trusted friends, but competition for promotions, bonuses, and being noticed. You have pretty much lost your family and friends and live your life largely alone. Congratulations, you are now a company-person and have sold your soul for power, influence, and money. If you had listened to the Church, you would have placed your relationship with God first, your family second, and your career dead last.</p>

            <h2 class="header-2">Going back to the Beginning</h2>

            <p class="para">Going back to the gospel passage, Jesus freed the man from the sin that paralyzed him. Because the man could not help himself, he relied on his friends for help to bring him to the Master so they He could heal him and give him new life. Sometimes we just don’t see that our life choices have crippled us. This is how intercessory prayer works: When you pray for someone else that the Master will heal someone you love. Sometimes, sins can manifest physically into ailments because we are body and spirit. What affects one can manifest through the other. Only confessing our sins to a priest to clear the path to spiritual healing and then physical healing if God wills it.</p>

            <p class="para">This freedom means to be free to do what you should and not anything you want. God gives us freedom to grow and develop into the person He made us to be. We can use the freedom He gives us to complete the mission He created us for or we can use that freedom for our own self-seeking purposes. Surely, no one sins and loses their freedom for the sake of sinning. The person usually has good intentions but as they continue on their journey they lose sight of the truth. The person starts making decisions that further isolates himself or herself from God and possibly other people. It is a slow journey; almost imperceptible.</p>

            <p class="para">Sometimes God will allow tragedy to befall a person caught in sin with the hope that that tragedy will open the person’s eyes so they will turn from sin and turn towards God’s freedom He offers. God would rather your physical body die than for your eternal soul to perish without Him. God will pull out all the stops to go after the one lost sheep. From our limited vantage point, we see God as cruel for allowing tragedy to befall someone we love or know. But for God it is a mercy because He sees our life from the point of eternity.</p>

            <p class="para">Now, you may be saying to yourself what I’ve written does not apply to your life. You may have lived your life in polar opposition to what the Church teaches and you have not encountered any negative consequences, at least none that you are willing to admit. Can you function during the day without a cup of coffee or relax without drinking alcohol or smoking a cigarette or marijuana? Are you always living your life in search of one pleasure after another whether it is shopping, social media, video games, or excessive sports? Can you remain in complete silence for an extended period of time without seeking a distraction from your own interior voice? Even seemingly benign things can rob you of the freedom that God wants to give you so you can fulfill His purpose for you.</p>

            <p class="para">In order to be free, you must have self-possession, and self-possession is only achieved through self-discipline. Without self-discipline you will go through life going from one passion to the next without focusing on what is the most important, which is your relationship with God. Eventually, you will retire. Eventually, you will lose your health. Eventually you will die; we all will. When you finally come face-to-face with Jesus, your Creator, don’t you want to know that your life had a purpose and meaning and that you fulfilled that purpose? Don’t you want to know that your life meant something and wasn’t just based on pleasure-seeking and randomness? Don’t you want to know that you left this world in a better place than when you found it? Don’t you want to know that you helped other people in your life get to heaven?</p>

            <p class="para">God’s freedom is shown to us through His Church; the Catholic Church. Jesus told Peter, “And I say to you, that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” You can be sure that what the Church teaches is true. The priests of the Church might not always say things the way we would like or behave the way we deserve, but her teachings remain incorruptible. But most of all trust in Jesus Who said that He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</p>

            <p class="para">The choice is yours. It has always been yours. You must choose wisely (Matthew 25:1-13)</p>

She’s drinking every night after work and is soon introduced into the wonderful world of cocaine by a friend and starts snorting the white stuff on Saturdays; and soon on Sundays too. She soon becomes addicted and cannot stop drinking or snorting cocaine. She is now a slave to alcohol and cocaine. They call her name day and night. She must answer the call because not answering will result in bad headaches and feeling severely ill. She has lost her freedom. If it continues she will lose her job, possibly her family, and at worse; her life. If she had listened to the Church and understood that her body was the temple of the Holy Spirit she would not have abused it.</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 4: </strong>You are a man who considers himself bisexual. You have only dated and had sex with women in the past, but that is getting old. You seek more excitement and variety. Soon you find yourself at gay bars meeting other men and hooking up with them. Times are good and you are making plenty of friends and having plenty of sexual encounters, but you are never completely satisfied. You take more chances by having riskier sexual encounters with both men and women. Sometimes you use condoms and other times you don’t. After all, using condoms can be a kill joy and the experience is what is most important.</p>

            <p class="para">A few years later, you start experiencing some weight loss, but think to yourself, "I must be doing something right with my diet and the gym." But, you keep dropping weight. Soon you start seeing sores on your mouth and you feel really tired all the time. You start applying lip balm to your lips and keep drinking coffee, but it doesn’t help. Then you get bouts of diarrhea that lasts more than week at a time. This last symptom is just too much to handle and you see a doctor. After asking you a series of questions the doctor gives you an order for a blood test. A few days later you get a call to come to the doctor’s office, and when the doctor walks in she looks a little nervous. She sits down across from you and says, “I’m sorry to inform you, but you have tested positive for HIV.” Your heart seems to skip a beat and you ask for the doctor to repeat what she just said, and you just sit there in shock as if the world just stopped. You can’t believe it. You say to yourself, “This wasn’t supposed to happen to me. This is what happens to other people.” </p>

            <p class="para">Growing up, you heard that the Catholic Church was against sex outside of marriage and you thought that those saying this were just sexually repressed grumpy old men who sought to scare and control their “flock” to fleece them. Now, after getting this terminal diagnosis, you think to yourself, “Maybe they were just trying to protect me against this very thing that is consuming me.”</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 5: </strong>You are a diocesan priest at a local parish. Ever since you were young, you always felt different and you were not like the other boys. When you got older, you found yourself attracted to other boys and older men. When you got older you made a decision to enter the seminary. You became a priest because you have always wanted to help others and by becoming a priest you would no longer get pestered by your parents and aunts asking why you didn’t have a girlfriend. As time goes on, the time you spend in front of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament decreases and your prayers become dry. The last time you went to confession was over four months ago and saying Mass has become a chore.</p>

            <p class="para">As time goes on, you start surfing the net instead of praying the rosary and you eventually stumble on a gay porn website. You find it exciting and say to yourself, “No one is getting hurt, and so what’s the harm?” As the weeks go on, your time on the Internet looking at porn increases to the point that you are only getting a few hours of sleep at night. You feel exhausted and out of sorts. You start to feel your life unraveling and your ordination to the priesthood a mistake. One day you confide your feelings to another priest friend who you think feels the same way. The next thing you know both of you become very close and before long you are having sex with each other. You begin drinking and taking drugs in a futile attempt to mask the pain, confusion, anger, sadness, shame, and anxiety you feel.</p>

            <p class="para">As the months go on, you get introduced to a wider circle of priest friends who are also like-minded. You begin having sex with some of them as well while vacationing. One time, you even had sex with a teenager who told you he was an altar server while at a party. You have stopped praying all together and have not gone to confession in over a year now. You feel that you are living a double-life and start to seriously doubt what the Catholic Church teaches; this is especially true what it teaches about homosexuality. Even during your homilies you stop mentioning anything about sin because you are not even sure if sin is even real. You start feeling uncomfortable being behind the altar saying the prayers of consecration over the gifts of bread and wine and your belief in the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist begins to seriously erode.</p>

            <p class="para">Months later while you are in the rectory you hear the doorbell ring and you find two police officers at the door. They ask for your name, and once you give it to them they tell you that you are being arrested for statutory rape of a minor. You then remember the teenage altar boy you had sex with at the party. You knew you should not have had sex with him, but you got caught up in the moment. Your life flashes before your eyes and you know that the choices you have made have led to this. It is then that a quote from scripture comes into mind, “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other.” If this priest had lived the teachings of the Church, none of this would have happened.</p>

            <p class="para">You might be thinking to yourself…these are extreme examples. Sure, they happen, but what about the vast majorities of people who don’t follow what the Church teaches and are perfectly fine? Well…let’s delve into that line of thinking.</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 6: </strong>You just bought yourself the new Android smart phone (sorry iPhone lovers). It has all the coolest features in it and you really enjoy catching up with distant friends on Facebook. Soon you keep finding yourself drawn to that cell phone while sitting down doing nothing, and then in between meetings at work. Over time, you find yourself looking at your phone while your kids are trying to talk to you and just answer, “Uh ha” when they say something. When your phone buzzes or beeps you stop conversations to look at the newest news or message. Your kids stop coming to you to ask questions because now you just ignore them, as you are caught up with your tech.</p>

            <p class="para">A few years later you buy your children their own smart phones because you want them to be more independent. After all, everyone has one. Soon afterwards though, you see your kids glued to their phones too. They don’t want to eat dinner with you anymore and stay up way past their bedtimes surfing the Internet and playing online games. You get upset seeing this, and say to yourself, “It looks like my kids are addicted to their phone, but not me. I’ll show them how to live in moderation.”</p>

            <p class="para">You say to yourself, “I can put this down anytime I want.” So you do…for five minutes. You start fidgeting and say to yourself, “I’ll just check the weather…no harm in that,” and bam…you find yourself surfing the net again. You, my friend, are addicted! You are not free anymore. Your cell phone has become your new drug and you crave it and can’t live without it and like a crack dealer, you even got your kids hooked on the tech. It has become more than a drug for you; it has become your god. You worship it and it controls what and when you do anything else. You can’t even leave it on a table without it in your hand. </p>

            <p class="para">Your relationship with your kids turns into just grunts of acknowledgement now. Everyone in your family just looks into a screen instead of into each other’s eyes. Meals are eaten alone and no one talks with each other anymore…your family is now a virtual family coming apart at the seams. If you listened to what the Church taught and took her teachings seriously you would know that anything, including technology, can become a god that can take the place of the One True and Ever-living God, the one who wants to give you life to the fullest.</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 7: </strong>You are poor, and struggle all the time to make ends meet. Your thought of finding new ways to make money is constantly on your mind and is a priority. It is pretty much the only thing that is on your mind and it consumes you. You always complain about not having enough money and how life is not fair. Over the years, the desire for money becomes intense. Your desire for money has now become your god and you are no longer free because all your decisions and all your thoughts revolve around money. Everything you do is for money or because of money, even your interactions with your family and friends now. One day you see your friends’ wallet on a table and you open it. There inside you see a hundred dollars in cash. You become envious and say to yourself, “I’ll just take fifty dollars. He won’t miss it anyways. And if he does, so what, he has plenty to spare.” Your friend finds out and tells you to get out of his apartment. You get mad at him and blame him and then leave his apartment in anger.</p>

            <p class="para">You become miserable and irritable and your love for life has been lost. If you knew that the love of money is the root of all evil, you would have done your best to not let yourself become sucked into worshipping something that would instead enslave you and make you all the more poorer.</p>

            <p class="para"><strong>Example 8: </strong>You work in Corporate America, and you want to climb the corporate ladder. You are not satisfied with your entry-level position and want to get promoted quickly. You start working late at night to show management that you are dedicated. Then you start taking on extra projects and begin working on weekends and your whole life begins to be consumed by your work. You think of nothing but work and how you can get noticed. Your whole life becomes absorbed with making a name for yourself and making more money.</p>

            <p class="para">Your career has become everything to you. Your office has become your altar that you offer to the gods of progress and success. You pass on opportunities to spend time with your family and friends and you start to alienate yourself from those who love you. When you do go out with them, you are constantly on your phone checking emails and responding to them. This bothers you a little, but you rationalize that sacrifices have to be made for your future. Before you know it, family and friends call you less to do things together. Sure you have “friends” at work, but they just go for drinks with you after work, but then go home to their families afterwards.</p>

            <p class="para">You are not free. You have wed yourself to your work and it consumes you. The humility and gratefulness you once had has been replaced by pride and arrogance. People at work are no longer trusted friends, but competition for promotions, bonuses, and being noticed. You have pretty much lost your family and friends and live your life largely alone. Congratulations, you are now a company-person and have sold your soul for power, influence, and money. If you had listened to the Church, you would have placed your relationship with God first, your family second, and your career dead last.</p>

            <h2 class="header-2">Going back to the Beginning</h2>

            <p class="para">Going back to the gospel passage, Jesus freed the man from the sin that paralyzed him. Because the man could not help himself, he relied on his friends for help to bring him to the Master so they He could heal him and give him new life. Sometimes we just don’t see that our life choices have crippled us. This is how intercessory prayer works: When you pray for someone else that the Master will heal someone you love. Sometimes, sins can manifest physically into ailments because we are body and spirit. What affects one can manifest through the other. Only confessing our sins to a priest to clear the path to spiritual healing and then physical healing if God wills it.</p>

            <p class="para">This freedom means to be free to do what you should and not anything you want. God gives us freedom to grow and develop into the person He made us to be. We can use the freedom He gives us to complete the mission He created us for or we can use that freedom for our own self-seeking purposes. Surely, no one sins and loses their freedom for the sake of sinning. The person usually has good intentions but as they continue on their journey they lose sight of the truth. The person starts making decisions that further isolates himself or herself from God and possibly other people. It is a slow journey; almost imperceptible.</p>

            <p class="para">Sometimes God will allow tragedy to befall a person caught in sin with the hope that that tragedy will open the person’s eyes so they will turn from sin and turn towards God’s freedom He offers. God would rather your physical body die than for your eternal soul to perish without Him. God will pull out all the stops to go after the one lost sheep. From our limited vantage point, we see God as cruel for allowing tragedy to befall someone we love or know. But for God it is a mercy because He sees our life from the point of eternity.</p>

            <p class="para">Now, you may be saying to yourself what I’ve written does not apply to your life. You may have lived your life in polar opposition to what the Church teaches and you have not encountered any negative consequences, at least none that you are willing to admit. Can you function during the day without a cup of coffee or relax without drinking alcohol or smoking a cigarette or marijuana? Are you always living your life in search of one pleasure after another whether it is shopping, social media, video games, or excessive sports? Can you remain in complete silence for an extended period of time without seeking a distraction from your own interior voice? Even seemingly benign things can rob you of the freedom that God wants to give you so you can fulfill His purpose for you.</p>

            <p class="para">In order to be free, you must have self-possession, and self-possession is only achieved through self-discipline. Without self-discipline you will go through life going from one passion to the next without focusing on what is the most important, which is your relationship with God. Eventually, you will retire. Eventually, you will lose your health. Eventually you will die; we all will. When you finally come face-to-face with Jesus, your Creator, don’t you want to know that your life had a purpose and meaning and that you fulfilled that purpose? Don’t you want to know that your life meant something and wasn’t just based on pleasure-seeking and randomness? Don’t you want to know that you left this world in a better place than when you found it? Don’t you want to know that you helped other people in your life get to heaven?</p>

            <p class="para">God’s freedom is shown to us through His Church; the Catholic Church. Jesus told Peter, “And I say to you, that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” You can be sure that what the Church teaches is true. The priests of the Church might not always say things the way we would like or behave the way we deserve, but her teachings remain incorruptible. But most of all trust in Jesus Who said that He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</p>

            <p class="para">The choice is yours. It has always been yours. You must choose wisely (Matthew 25:1-13)</p>
