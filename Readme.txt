Project Title
	AOM-Project - This project is my first Internet accessible development project. I've created this website to be fully responsive from a variety of 		devices. This is a basic website that uses HTML5, CSS3, and some JQuery to allow headers and footers to be inserted in the top and bottom of each page.


Getting Started
	There is nothing you will need to install to get this environment up and running except for a text editor or IDE. I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) 	to build this website. I built this website on a laptop running Windows 7, SP2. 

Prerequisites
	The only prerequisite is a text editor. If you are interested in downloading VS Code you can go to: https://code.visualstudio.com/download. You can 	download this code onto Windows, Mac, or Linux machines. 


Installing
	Nothing needs to be installed to run this web application.

Running the Tests
	Because I am just learning to develop, there is no automation for testing associated with this website. Since I only used JQuery to insert the header 	and footer, there is no programming per se that can be tested using automation.
