        <h2 class="header-2">Have you left the Catholic Church because you felt you were spiritually starved?</h2>
        <img class="left-img" id="empty" src="../img/empty-church1.jpg" alt="empty church">

        <p>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been at Mass and said to myself, “What just happened? I don’t feel like I got anything from this Mass.” Sometimes the way priests celebrate the Holy Mass is lackluster and the homily can put you to sleep. And don’t get me started with some of the parishioners who treat you like you are an inconvenience. You might as well have just stayed home! Yes, I have had these experiences, but I’ve also had some great experiences at Mass. I have been at parishes where parishioners smile at you and welcome you, and where the priest’s homilies and reverence at Mass is truly inspiring.</p><br>

        <p>I have known people who have left the Catholic Church because they felt they were not growing spiritually and joined a non-denominational, evangelical or Pentecostal church to seek what they felt they were missing. Basically, they felt that they were not hearing the word of God during Mass. I will not judge you or anyone who leaves the Catholic Church because I have not walked in your shoes and don’t understand the challenges you’ve experienced in trying to live your faith and deepen your relationship with Jesus.</p><br>

        <p>I would ask, however, that you give the Catholic Church another chance if you are open to it. Why do I bring this up if you have already left? I do because you clicked on this link, which makes me believe that there is a little part of your heart that misses the Catholic Church and its beauty. I will try the best I can to provide some reasons to come back below:</p>

        <ul class="home-ul">
            <li>The words that the priest and the parishioners recite during one <a href="https://aleteia.org/2017/08/12/who-says-catholics-dont-hear-the-bible-at-mass/" target="blank">Mass</a> has more scriptural verses in it than most protestant pastors will speak in many services. </li>
            <li>By attending Mass just on Sundays you would hear about 10% of the Old Testament and 40% or more of the New Testament in 3 years. If you went to daily Mass over the course of 3 years, you would hear about 80% to 90% of the bible proclaimed during readings.</li>
            <li>You are receiving the <a href="http://www.usccb.org/bible/john/6:46" target="blank">Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Jesus</a> Himself at each Mass</li>
            <li>Even with the Eucharist received at Holy Mass is the source and summit of Christian life, the Church has even more to offer. Like what? Like…
                <ul>
                    <li>Prayer groups at parishes (like the Apostles of Mary)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.cursillos.ca/en/cursillo.htm" target="blank">Cursillo and Ultreya</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.bostoncatholic.org/CCRS.aspx" target="blank">Charismatic prayer groups</a></li>
                    <li>Retreats (silent and directed) offered by just about all monasteries </li>
                    <li>Bible study groups</li>
                    <li>Parish sponsored pilgrimages to holy places</li>
                    <li>All kinds of different activities at different parishes; you just need to ask</li>
                    <li>Youth Conferences, Mens Conferences, and Womens Conferences</li>
                    <li>Healing Masses</li>
                    <li>Tridentine Masses (Latin Rite)</li>
                    <li>Third Orders (Marist, Dominican, Carmelite, Franciscan, etc.) Each order has its own unique charisms that will resonate with different people.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The other thing that I tell people is that you get out of Mass what you put into it. I mean that if you rush to Mass (or even an evangelical service for that matter) you won’t get much out of it. You need to prepare your heart, mind and soul to properly encounter God. You need to ask the Holy Spirit to open your heart and mind and be open to God so He can work within you.</p><br>

        <p>If you have any questions you can either go to the Contact page or email me at: <a href="mailto:apostlesofmarypeabody@gmail.com">apostlesofmarypeabody@gmail.com</a> and I will be more than happy to answer any questions you might have. I also encourage you to visit the Catholic Stuff page, as it has many links to other websites and YouTube videos that will do a far better job than me of explaining the many different aspects of the Catholic faith.</p><br>

        <p>If you are interested, come and see. There is no commitment on your part to attend Holy Mass or any of the activities the Church has to offer. The only thing I would caution you on is that you should refrain from receiving the Most Holy Eucharist until you have seen a priest and gone to confession if you decide to come back to the Church. The Catholic understanding of the Eucharist is different from those churches in the Protestant Faith Tradition. Protestants generally hold that the bread and wine are merely symbols of Jesus and so they are. However, the Catholic Church in its Holy Orders has the power to call down the Holy Spirit to transform bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Jesus. We believe that the host is no longer ordinary bread, but Jesus Himself under the appearance of bread. It is a huge difference and I would plead with you to respect this difference if you decide to attend Mass.</p><br>
 
        <p> I am not here to compel anyone to come back to the Catholic Church, but seek to dispel any misunderstands you may have.  “May the Lord bless you and keep you; may the Lord cause His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; may the Lord lift up His countenance toward you and give you peace.”</p><br>

        <div id="hurt"></div>
        <h2 class="header-2">Have you left the Catholic Church because someone in the Church hurt you?</h2>
        <img class="left-img" id="shame" src="../img/shame1.jpeg" alt="man with head in hands">
        
        <p>It feels like there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t see something in the news related to priests or bishops sexually abusing young adults, children, and even seminarians we are hearing now. To make matters worse, bishops have covered up abuses with arrogance, transferred victimizers to other parishes free to abuse again, and paid hush money to devastated families. These actions are befitting of a criminal organization, not the Church Jesus founded. This whole situation has driven me to my knees in tears at times begging the Father to heal those affected and their families and for justice and reparations to be made. My anger at times is too much at times. I have found myself yelling in my car on the way to work out of frustration.  As I think that the hands of the priests that were anointed to heal and call down the power of the Holy Spirit to transform bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Jesus were used to commit unspeakable acts against those who trusted them.</p><br>

        <p>As a father, devout Catholic, Catechist, and Third Order Marist, this evil infecting the Catholic Church has really affected me more than I can express. It is a horrible evil that has ruined the lives of many people causing depression, anxiety, confidence issues, and intrusive thoughts that re-traumatize those affected. Some people have turned to alcohol, drugs, or promiscuity to cover the pain while others have taken their own lives in a last ditch attempt to be freed from the demons that haunt them. I pray that they are at peace now with the Good Shepherd.</p><br>

        <p>I write these things not to put a focus on my feelings at the expense of your pain, but that you might know that I and others like me know what is going on and are on your side. You have many people praying for you and want to be there for you in your time of suffering to help you heal. We want the priests and bishops who have committed these crimes to be punished, repent, and be saved. We want the Church to be purified and resurrected to be the instrument of love, mercy, and salvation for everyone. </p><br>

        <p>In all this, I have asked God ‘the’ question that everyone asks. Why, God? Why did this happen and how can I trust a priest or bishop ever again? I remember a visionary from Medjugorje by the name of Marija being asked why God allows war. She said that mankind that creates war; not God. I believe this wisdom can be applied to the sex abuse devastation occurring in the Church. It has occurred not because these priests and bishops were living the teachings of the Church. No, it occurred precisely because they abandoned Jesus and the faith that He left the Church through His apostles. Like our first parents, these priests and bishops said no to God as well and wanted to do their will and not the will of the Father. </p><br>

        <p>The other question I have asked is, “How God could let this happen?” For this I don’t have an answer. I know that God sees us from a point of eternity and not just our earthly life. God did not ordain these things to happen, but allowed them because if He stopped them He would have interfered with free will, which is God’s gift to us. It is just beyond anyone’s understanding the mind of God. I do know that God grieves with us over these events and the priests and bishops that have committed these horrific acts will be judged severely.</p><br>

        <p>I have known many good and holy priests and bishops in my life. I have seen them demonstrate their love for their flock first hand and I know I can trust them. They live a life close to the heart of Jesus and seek to imitate Mary in her love for her Son. They grieve over these atrocities of their brother priests and bishops and suffer because of it. As Jesus said,  “For a good tree does not bear bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. For every tree is known by its fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, not do they gather grapes from a bramble bush. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure in his heart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.” (Luke 6: 43-45).</p><br>

        <p>As your brothers and sisters in Jesus the Christ we seek to walk with you in your pain and help carry your cross and pray for your healing and wholeness if you allow us to. In the spirit of the Marists who have no other model than the early Church, we seek to love you as Jesus loves us. I know it can be difficult to trust people from the Church after what has happened to you, but I pray you will give us a chance to walk with you in your spiritual journey.</p><br>

        <div id="not-believe"></div><br><br>
        <h2 class="header-2">Have you left the Catholic Church because you don’t believe what it teaches any longer?</h2>
        <img class="unbelief-img" id="no-god" src="../img/no-god.jpg" alt="No God Sign">

        <p>Let’s face it; there are many teachings of the Catholic Church that are difficult for people to accept for their own personal reasons. I’m not sure what your reasons are, but the fact that you are reading this makes me think that there is something inside of you that yearns to reconnect with the Church somehow even if you carry feelings of resentment in your heart.</p><br>

        <p>Every person who leaves the Catholic Church because they disagree with her teachings has their own unique reasons for doing so. Sometimes it is based on a situation that occurred in a parish that angered or hurt you. Perhaps a priest or lay person didn’t give you a satisfactory answer to a very important question you had, or even worse, blew you off. If that happened I apologize on behalf of the Church. This should never happen.</p><br>

        <p>Perhaps you left the Church because you believe what you’ve read in the bible are just fanciful stories with no basis in reality. It is very easy to read a passage in the bible and come away with the wrong interpretation if you don’t understand how people in biblical times wrote letters, or has an understanding of Jewish or Greek idioms, the customs of biblical people, their history, or even how to interpret biblical or literary texts.  It has taken me decades of study to learn and I’m still learning.</p><br>

        <p>You might have found yourself in a situation that makes it difficult or impossible for you to fully participate in the life of the Church. The three most common situations I have seen are being remarried outside the Church after a divorce, having sexual relations with others outside of marriage (whether you are straight or gay), or having had an abortion. It might seem like the Church is fixated on sex, but in reality it is not. The reason why these three issues come up all the time is because society has gradually embraced these ways of living. At one time, maybe 50 or 60 years ago, the Church and society had the same beliefs and this was a non-issue. In our current age, society believes that sexual ideals and morals are fluid, whereas the Catholic Church believes that human sexuality has a specific goal, is grounded by natural law, and has a divine aspect of it that mirrors the Holy Trinity. The Church believes in eternal, objective truths that are hardwired into us. If we change them we will suffer the consequences. The Church, as mother, wants to protect her children from this pain.</p><br>

        <p>Father Colin, the founder of the Marist Fathers, believed that we should not only walk in another’s shoes to understand them but be in their skin, as it were, to truly understand their feelings and experiences. The only way we can do this is by being open to listening to each other’s stories to understand how each other got to where we are and how and why we see the world as we do. The reason our world is in the current situation with people hating each other is because we dehumanize and demonize each other instead of listening to one another and trying to understand each other. We may never come to an agreement on certain issues, but we should treat each other as children of God and find common ground to build on where possible.</p><br>
        
        <p>If you are thinking of coming back to the Church and want to understand how your specific situation would affect fully participating in the life of the Church you can always contact a priest or deacon at your local parish. If you are not sure who to contact you are more than welcome to contact me and I’ll try to find someone who can help you. Oftentimes, there are remedies to situations, and it just takes speaking to someone knowledgeable who can help you discern your options.</p><br>

        <p>If you are not interested in coming back to the Catholic Church I do not wish to infringe on your decision. God gives everyone free will to live their life as they choose.  I will pray that the Lord helps and guides you in your life that you may fulfill His plans for you in whatever capacity that may be.</p>

        <div id="atheist"></div><br><br>
        <h1 class="atheist-header">To those who are not sure God exists and have not yet felt His love, yet yearn to...</h1>

        <div id="hope"></div><br><br>
        <h2 class="header-2">Are you hoping that there is a God but don’t believe for lack of evidence?</h2>
        <img class="unbelief-img" id="space" src="../img/space1.jpg" alt="picture of galaxies">

        <p>I’m assuming that by you coming to section of this page that you may identify as an atheist or an agnostic. Maybe you would love to believe that this life is not the end, but based on the evidence you have encountered, it just does not seem possible. We’ve all been taught since children that there are happy endings and there certainly is something innate within us that seek happiness. We are designed to run away from pain and embrace things in life that give us happiness and pleasure.</p><br>

        <p>Now, there is nothing I can tell you to convince you that there is a God and an afterlife. We could argue mathematical probability and chance formation of life all day long without coming to an agreement one way or another. So, it would be useless to try to argue for God’s existence that way.</p><br>

        <p>I can tell you that as a Catholic, the Church believes God exists outside of space and time. As such, God cannot be measured, observed, or experimented with because our instruments, which are made out of material, can only detect other materials directly or the presence of that material. We believe that God exists outside of space and time because the material that exploded via the big bang (which was theorized by a Catholic Jesuit priest and cosmologist, Father Georges Lemaitre) had to have been started by a force external to itself. Now, I realize there are arguments in the scientific community about matter being spontaneously created by virtual particles annihilating each other in an extremely short period of time within a field.  But, the question that then needs to be asked is what created the particles in the first place? This is something for scientists to argue over. I have no skin in the game on it and neither does the Church.</p><br>

        <p>As a Catholic, I find science fascinating, as it explains the “how” of the universe we live in. But, science cannot explain the “why”. This is why I believe that science and religion are complimentary; not enemies.</p><br>

        <p>So, what can I tell you to “prove” that God exists to change your mind? Nothing…absolutely nothing. But, I can tell you a true story that happened to my father, a testimony I heard from someone I once knew, and a personal testimony.</p><br>

        <h3 class="hope-header-3">It is not your time</h3>
        <img class="hope-img" id="jesus" src="../img/light-of-jesus.jpg" alt="Jesus is the light">

        <p>My father was a Marine in an organization called Force Troops in the late 50’s and early 60’s. This organization was under the direct command of the President of the United States and they engaged in reconnaissance and black ops. On one particular mission, his four-man team was sent hundreds of miles behind enemy lines and remained there for many months. One day his team encountered enemy combatants, in which hand-to-hand combat ensued. During the struggle, my father’s team managed to kill them all, but my father was severely wounded. He was struck in the head by the butt of a gun and 12 blood vessels in his head ruptured. Shortly afterwards, my father’s team received orders to head to an extraction point about 300 miles away. The team leader asked my father if he was able to make the hike. If not, he had orders to kill my father, as he could not be taken alive by the enemy. My father told his team leader that he was okay and would make it.</p><br>

        <p>Some months later, my father’s team made it to the extraction point and was picked up. A few days later after debriefings finished there was an inspection in my father’s tent. It was then that everything went black and he collapsed. A corpsman was called who knew that something was seriously wrong with my father. After my father revived, the corpsman took my father to the closest military hospital, which was an Army one. Any Army doctor checked my father out, but could not find anything wrong with him. Not convinced, the corpsman took my father to a naval hospital some miles away. The naval surgeon put a scope to my father’s eyes and told the corpsman that he saw damage behind my father’s eyes and he needed to do some additional tests to understand the extent of the damage.</p><br>

        <p>My father was prepped and wheeled into an operating room and the doctor and medical staff started an arteriogram procedure.  Soon afterwards, my father coded. His heart had stopped. My father told me that he still remembers this like it was yesterday. He said that he popped out of his body and was floating near the ceiling. He could see and hear everything that was happening in the room. He would later tell the doctors exactly what they were doing, what they were wearing, and what they were saying to each other. They were simply dumbfounded, as he was clinically dead.</p><br>

        <p>Some moments afterwards, my father said he was propelled through a dark space and ended up standing in a grassy field. He said that the colors he saw were more vibrant than he ever saw before, with more colors that he ever saw on earth. He felt an overwhelming sense of peace that enveloped him. He felt no pain and he didn’t want to leave that place. Out in the distance was a tree line and he could make out people standing there. Some of the people he recognized, while others he didn’t.</p><br>

        <p>While my father was a gaze at the scenery and the people he saw he felt a presence to his right. When he turned his head to see what it was, he saw a being made of light standing before him, brighter than the sun, but it didn’t hurt his eyes. My father told me that he knew it was Jesus. I asked him how, and he told me that he still had nail holes in his hands and feet. My father was mesmerized and walked towards Jesus, but Jesus only held out his hand and said that my father had to go back; that it was not his time yet. Well, my father being a typical Marine said no and that he wasn’t going back and kept walking towards Jesus. When my father finally was in front of Jesus he held out both hands and put them on my father’s shoulders saying that he had to go back and in a flash my father fell backwards all the way back into his body.</p><br>

        <p>My father opened his eyes in pain and looked down. At the bottom of the bed that he found himself lying on was the naval surgeon and the corpsman. The naval doctor said, “Marine, do you know what the corpsman has in his hand?” My father said, “No sir,” to which the surgeon said, “It is your death certificate. You have been dead for 7 minutes.”</p><br>

        <p>My father convalesced in the hospital for about 6 months before being sent home. One night while he was speaking to his mother, he told her this story. She left the room and came back a few minutes later with an old photo album that my father had never seen before. When my grandmother opened it my father recognized many of the people in it that he saw while in heaven. Some were relatives that he had known when he was younger who had died, while others had passed away before my father was born.</p><br>

        <h3 class="hope-header-3">On the mountain</h3>
        <img class="hope-img" id="hill" src="../img/apparition-hill1.jpg" alt="apparition hill Medjugorje">

        <p>The second story comes from an experience I had back in 2001. I went to Medjugorje on pilgrimage, which is a place where Marian apparitions are still occurring since 1981. I was with a group of people from the state that I live in. One of the days our group had an opportunity to attend an apparition with Ivan; one of the visionaries. We were all there, but one person. I will call him Frank. Frank was not interested in attending the apparition, but instead wanted to climb Apparition Hill to pay atop of the mountain.</p><br>

        <p>That night, we all came together for dinner and Frank looked a little strange and out of sorts. After dinner, he told us that he had something to tell us that happened to him on the mountain. He told us that he went up to the mountain to pray and carried with him a shoulder bag with some water and a blanket. When he got there he took out the blanket and put it on the rocks at the top of the mountain to pray. After some time after he finished his prayers he started down the mountain. As Frank descended the mountain he heard a man call his name. Frank looked around at the few other people on the mountain but didn’t see anyone he recognized and kept walking. After a few steps he heard someone calling his name again. This time when he looked to where he heard the voice calling him from he saw a man dressed in white standing near him.</p><br>

        <p>Frank didn’t recognize the man and asked, “Do I know you?” The man said, “No, but I know you.” The man then asked Frank what he had in his bag and Frank said some water and a towel to lie on the rocks as he prayed. The man said that towels are also good for wiping tears.  As Frank was relating this story to us, he started crying and stopped. Frank gained his composure and said that the man said to him, “Don’t worry, your daughter will be alright.” Frank said that he started crying on the mountain and when he wiped his eyes and looked back up the man in white vanished. Frank looked for the guy but he was nowhere to be found and there weren’t many people on the mountain to obscure his sight. Frank then said that his daughter had advanced cancer and was fighting for her life back home. Everyone was deeply touched by the story.</p><br>

        <p>Fast forward a few months later…we all met at Frank’s house as a reunion. Frank’s face was all aglow and he made an announcement. He asked everyone if they remember the story he told about the man in white and his daughter. We all were like who could forget! Then Frank told us that when he returned home from Medjugorje his daughter had been completely healed from cancer!</p><br>

        <p>You may believe that the body can cure itself of cancer in the snap of a finger, but I do not. Frank’s daughter is one of a multitude of people who have been cured of cancer overnight and doctors are baffled as to how. This is certainly not proof that God exists, but I think is strong evidence for God’s existence and His love for us.</p><br>

        <h3 class="hope-header-3">Healed from pornography</h3>
        <img class="hope-img" id="healed" src="../img/healed.jpg" alt="man suffering in darkness">

        <p>I was introduced to pornography by a friend around 1977. He gave me a box of pictures he had cut from some Hustler and Penthouse magazines and a later on gave me two magazines. I was mesmerized and would sneak peaks at it in my bedroom just about every day. It was exciting, but I also knew that it was wrong. I hid the magazines under my mattress and the photos I ended up throwing out.</p><br>

        <p>As I got older my desire for pornography deepened. When I was in college I frequented strip clubs with a friend of mine almost every week. When Internet pornography started to become more prevalent back in mid-90’s I started going to those websites and this really fueled my imagination. I was looking at pornography at least 2 hours a day and could not break the habit. I was not dating, as I lost the ability to relate to women in any normal capacity. My days were spent at work and at night looking at pornography and going to the gym. I knew what I was doing was not healthy and it was having a significant impact on my life in a bad way. I was living a life of hypocrisy, as I attended Church every week, yet had this dark secret. It was as if I was leading a double life.</p><br>

        <p>In 1998, I started to be drawn to spiritual things for some reason. I just can’t explain why, but I felt that just going to Church on Sundays just wasn’t enough to satisfy me. I started reading books on near-death experiences and out-of-body experiences. I remember going to the local bookstore and buying a book on a Marian apparition. I remembered reading a book on Fatima as child that my grandmother gave me and it always stuck in my mind. As I read the book it turned me off. It was really bizarre reading. I looked up the author and her writings were condemned by the Catholic Church. I ended up throwing the book in the trash, but I was still drawn towards mysticism and spirituality.</p><br>

        <p>I went back to the bookstore in search of another book a few days later. I came across a blue book with a beautiful image of the Blessed Mother, but it didn’t look like a painting. Rather, it looked like a fuzzy picture and it captivated me. The book was called, “Medjugorje: The Message” by Wayne Weible. I bought the book and could not put it down. It literally changed my life. I began reading the bible daily, going to confession as often as I needed, fasting as best I could twice a week, praying the rosary every day, and attending Mass as frequently as I could. I strongly desired to go to Medjugorje but had no idea how I would get there.  Even with this, I struggled mightily with pornography. I just couldn’t beat the addiction.</p><br>

        <p>In 1999, I moved to another city. I found out that the local parish had a Charismatic prayer group, which I started to attend. I felt disgusting with myself the more I steeped myself in the Holy Spirit and new I had to stop looking at pornography, but the addiction I had made it impossible. I had been looking at pornography for 22 years and stopping was impossible without intervention.</p><br>

        <p>In 2001, I was invited by a friend to Medjugorje. I could not believe it! I was so excited to go. I stayed there for 10 days, which were the most peaceful I’ve ever had; especially since I didn’t have access to a computer there. Towards the end of my stay I went to confession with a priest from Scotland. I bared my soul about my addiction and he gave me absolution and prayed with me for a few minutes. I didn’t feel any different, but God was working on me.</p><br>

        <p>When I got back home I noticed that I didn’t want to look at pornography. It was strange. I thought for sure I would cave and go onto one of my favorite sites as soon as I got home. This euphoria lasted a week or so and then I succumbed to temptation and looked at pornography again. I was devastated. I thought I finally broke free of this addiction. I went to confession and tried to stay away from pornography, but that was short-lived. One night, I looked at some of my favorite sites and went to bed and turned out the lights. I was so disgusted with myself; and then something horrifying happened. I felt this evil presence in my room and I was terrified. The presence was so strong that I knew if I opened my eyes I would see the devil himself. I could not move my body and was paralyzed in fear. Then I heard within my mind and soul an evil laugh, as if the devil was playing with me. My mind was racing and my whole body shook. I remember yelling out loud, “Jesus, Jesus, save me” and as soon as I did this the oppressive presence was gone and peace surrounded me.</p><br>

        <p>The next morning, I got up very early and went to confession before work started. I went to a face-to-face confession because I was so shaken up. I told the priest what had happened and he gave me absolution. Then he extended his hand and put it on my head and prayed over me for a minute or so and I was totally at piece. That was the last time I ever looked at pornography. It has been 17 years since that day and I am online every day for work and home stuff and have never looked at pornography again. I’ve known of people who have had bad pornography and sex addictions like me and people in this situation take years of self-help or through therapy to break the addiction, and recidivism is high.</p><br>

        <p>I’ve always asked myself, if I was healed of this pornography addiction in Medjugorje why did I fall in sin again by looking at it? I think it was for God to show me that I would be giving my life over to Satan and that I could be damned to hell because of the selfishness of looking at women who I had no business looking at. Pornography is an epidemic in this country and the world and it is slowly dimming the light of respect for life and destroys marriages, relationship and lives.</p><br>

        <p>I was not cured of cancer, and I didn’t see Jesus like my father, but I was given a new lease on life nonetheless. I am now married with two daughters. I feel happy now and fulfilled. I still struggle with intrusive memories from all the porn I’ve watched in my life from time-to-time, but I offer them up to God and pray for the women whose images I’ve seen that they too may be free.</p><br>

        <h2 class="header-2">Did something devastating happened in your life and your prayers were not answered? Did you in turn give up your belief in God?</h2>
        <img class="unbelief-img" id="ocean" src="../img/ocean.jpg" alt="looking out into the dark ocean">

        <p>Has something happen to you or a loved one that completely devastated you? In your grief did you ask God, “Why?” only to be met with deafening silence? You try to make sense of it but cannot.  Your world has been tossed upside down, never to return to the way it was. It could have been from something that happened to you or someone you love or know.</p><br>

        <p>Suffering like this reminds me of the disciples who followed Jesus as he preached, healed, and gave hope to the hopeless. They all believed that Jesus was the long awaited Messiah who would free the people of Israel from the iron grip of the Roman Empire. They thought it was only a matter of time when Jesus would raise an army and forcibly remove the Romans from their land.</p><br>

        <p>Then the unthinkable happened. Jesus was betrayed by one of the apostles, Judas, on a Thursday night for 30 pieces of silver. Jesus was captured by temple guards, given a speedy mock trial by religious leaders, and locked in a dark, deep, putrid hole. During that night Peter, his most trusted apostle, denied him three times by people in the crowd. By morning Jesus was dragged out of the hole, convicted, scourged to within an inch of his life, and by noontime was nailed to a cross and died three hours later. Before he died, people could hear him cry out, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” Now his lifeless, mangled and shredded body hung on the cross with his face frozen in a mask of twisted agony. EVERYONE was in shock. Just last night the apostles ate the Passover meal with him and now at 3:00 PM his dead body hung from a rough-hewn cross.</p><br>

        <p>Judas and Peter reacted by this horrific event differently after it occurred. Judas went into despair because of his guilt. He tied rope around a tree and hung himself.  Peter, on the other hand, was also grieved that he denied Jesus not once, not twice, but three times. However, Peter knew that Jesus was God made flesh and knew that God would forgive him if he repented.</p><br>

        <p>During events in our life that utterly devastate and crush us, we are faced with two paths; one path is the path of learning and healing that Peter took and the other path is one of closing oneself off to God and going into despair, as Judas did. Every one of us needs to decide on what path to take when devastation happens in our life. It is easy to give in to despair and to lose our belief in God. There is a great article written by Charlie Johnston called, “Into the Whirlwind” that is a meditation on the <a href="http://www.usccb.org/bible/job/0" target="blank">Book of Job</a>, who was a good man afflicted with one tragedy after another.

        <h2 class="header-2">Are you interested in Christianity but are not sure where to start?</h2>
        <img id="lost" src="../img/lost-sheep2.jpg" alt="finding the lost">

        <p>The number of ‘nones’ is steadily growing in the world, especially in the West. More and more people have been and are growing up without any type of religious affiliation. I’m making an assumption that you may be one of these people, or perhaps you did attend some Church, synagogue, temple or mosque when you were younger but drifted away for personal reasons. Or perhaps you are just curious what you will find here.</p><br>

        <p>If you are attracted to the teachings of Jesus and looking for a church to attend it can be a daunting task. So, where to begin? There are three major Christian Faith Traditions: Catholicism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodoxy. The Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Churches can trace their lineage directly back to the Apostles, where all Protestant Churches (over 20,000 of them) trace their beginnings back to the Protestant Reformation that began in the early 1500’s. Many mainline Protestant Churches hold to some traditional apostolic teachings, but many of those do not recognize sacraments, church authority or the Pope. The newer Churches (evangelical, Pentecostal, non-denominational) have even fewer traditional beliefs and some like Unitarian Churches have virtually no traditional doctrines at all.</p><br>

        <p>Based on this, I would start looking at either the Catholic Church or an Eastern Orthodox Church, as both have apostolic lineage and you have assurance that their teachings are consistent with apostolic teaching as handed onto them from Jesus Himself. The next question is what are the differences between the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy? The Eastern Orthodox does not recognize the authority of the Pope, and considers him first among equals. The Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church also do not agree precisely on the Nicene Creed, which is what all Christian Churches believe. The Catholic Church believes that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son, where the Orthodox Church believes the Holy Spirit proceeds from only the Father. Other than that, with some minor exceptions, both Churches have the same sacraments and same beliefs.</p><br>

        <p>The next question is why should you look into the Catholic Church as opposed to the Orthodox Church? First off let me say that the Orthodox faith is rich in history, holiness, truth and beauty. It is comprised of a number of self-governing Churches. They have a common approach to Sacred Tradition, theology, and worship and the Churches are divided mainly among geographic or cultural boundaries (like Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, etc.) The only challenge these Churches have is if there is a theological dispute that occurs between these Churches they don’t have a central authority to decide what is correct, as the Catholic Church does.</p><br>

        <p>As Catholics, we believe that Jesus made Peter the rock on which He would build His Church. Jesus gave Peter authority to bind and lose the faithful on matters of faith and morals. After Peter was executed, Linus was elected. After Linus other popes were elected all the way to our present time with Pope Francis sitting on the chair of Peter. Throughout the history of Christianity, the Popes have been pivotal in ensuring the deposit of faith entrusted to the Church was kept intact. Jesus gave a promise the gates of hell would not prevail against His Church. The gates of hell mean that the Church would never fail in her mission, which is to be an instrument for the salvation of the world. To do this, the Church must be kept free from error in what she teaches.</p><br>

        <p>Based on my explanation, I would start your faith journey with the Catholic Church. I recommend that you go to the <a href="catholic.html">Catholic Stuff</a> link where you will find plenty of resources to help you understand Christianity and get you started in the right direction.
