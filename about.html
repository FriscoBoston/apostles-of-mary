        <h1 class="header-1">About Us</h1>

        <p>We are a new small parish community that was established in January of 2018 at Saint Adelaide's Church in West Peabody, Massachusetts. We are a Marian community that is based on Marist spirituality. We do not call ourselves a Marist community because we did not want people to feel excluded from the group if they did not want to become a lay Marist. Our vision is for this to small group to grow into a parish community of believers who will praise and worship Jesus in the way of Mary, and reach out to the local community to help them grow in their Christian vocation.</p>
    
        <p>The inspiration for our parish community began a year prior to it even being started. During one Sunday Mass, our co-pastor, Father David, had mentioned that he would like to see a Marian prayer group be established at the parish. This really got me thinking and praying about taking up this challenge. As a Third Order Marist, I seek to imitate Mary in her love for her Son, Jesus. I prayed for a year and kept putting it off, but the call kept on coming back to me. I finally started speaking with Father David who gave me permission if I wished to start it.</p>
    
        <h2 class="header-2">Why the Name Apostles of Mary?</h2>

        <img class="marist-crest" src="../img/Marist_Crest_Gold.jpg" alt="Marist Crest">
    
        <p>The name does not imply that we follow or worship Mary because that would be idolatry. The word apostle is used in the generic sense, which means one who is sent. Marist history shows that Mary, through her gracious invitation, called for the Marists to be formed to reach out to those who had abandoned the faith during the French Revolution and heal the wounds it caused. Marists are sometimes called the least Marian and most Marian of all believers because the Marists do not have its own Marian devotions, rather Marists seek to imitate Mary in everything they do.</p>
    
        <h2 class="header-2">What this community is not</h2>
    
        <p>I cannot state in stronger words that this community does not worship Mary. Rather, we take her as our role model as the truest disciple of her Son. Afterall, she is the only one who ever loved Jesus the way He deserved to be loved. We seek to do the same. This community is also not limited to only those who are or wish to be Marists. We have members who belong to other Third Orders as well as everyday people who want to worship God as a community of believers. This community does not desire dues, or commitments. As Jesus said to His disciples, "Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give."(Matthew 10:8). People are free to come and go as they please.</p>
    
        <h2 class="header-2">Our Goal</h2>
    
        <p>The goal of this parish community is three-fold. The first is to grow in our love of Jesus our King in the way of Mary. The second is to build each other up in prayer, knowledge, and fraternal love. The third is to bring the love of Jesus to our parish community in whatever way the Holy Spirit calls us to.</p>

        <h2 class="header-2">Our location</h2>

        <p>We are located at 708 Lowell Street, in Peabody, MA 01960.</p>
