            <h1 class="why">Why Marist?</h1>
            
            <p>You might be wondering why this community is based on Marist spirituality. This community realized that the times we now live in closely resemble the times when the Marists began, which was over 200 years ago shortly after the French Revolution ended in 1799. Not only did the French destroy the monarchy, but it also devastated the Catholic Church that was closely associated with the monarchy. Bishops and priests were exiled from France, tortured, and executed. Convents and monasteries were closed, and monks and nuns were coerced to marry. Many people lost faith and others became enemies of the Church. </p><br>

             <img class="smile" src="../img/ourladysmile.jpg" alt="Image of Blessed Mother">

            <p>Today the Church is not under attack like during and after the French Revolution, however, religion, especially Christianity is increasingly being attacked, ridiculed, and pushed out of the public square. Governments have gradually stripped the Church of its influence. Priests and consecrated religious have left the Church in droves, and the Church is beset with one scandal after another further weakening its influence within society. Church attendance is less than 30% and many Catholics don’t believe what the Church has believed and taught since Jesus walked the earth.</p><br>

            <p>The Marists grew out of a fractured nation. After Napoleon’s failed attempt at fixing the rift between the Pope and the French secularists, France was a fractured nation.  It was polarized between those who saw the state as having ultimate say on all matters including religious matters, and those who believed that the Catholic Church had final say on spiritual matters and things dealing with religious expression. </p><br>


            <p>Father Colin who is considered the founder of Marist Priests understood that to reach out to people who grew up without religion and those who had witnessed the stern and pompous clergy before the revolution the Marists had to be different. Colin knew that the Church must become a Marian Church to bring back those who had not known the love of God. </p><br>

           
            <h2 class="heading-2">What does it mean to be Marian and why is it important?</h2>

            <h3 class="heading-3">It means to be called by a gracious choice of Mary...</h3>

            <p><span class="bold">It means to be called by gracious choice of Mary herself.</span> Mary said, “Here is what I want…a Society, which will have my name, which will call itself the Society of Mary, whose members will call themselves Marists.” It means to sense being called by Mary to share in her work to bring her children to her Son. The unity of all Marists is being united in the name and spirit of Mary.</p><br>

            <p><span class="bold">It means being the support of the Church.</span> As Mary was the support of the Church at its birth, she wants to support the Church in these times through a family of believers who bear her name living in her spirit by gathering the whole world to her Son, to be touched by God’s mercy and becoming united in one heart and mind.</p><br>

            <h3 class="heading-3">It means to imitate Mary...</h3>

            <p><span class="bold">Think as Mary, judge as Mary, feel and act as Mary in all things.</span> Like then and like now, the world will not listen to in-your-face evangelism. Instead, Marists look to Mary as their role model and adopt her way of thinking, of judging, of feeling and acting. This way becomes a way of life for Marists. It is not in particular Marian devotions that we accomplish this but in imitation of Mary’s faith and attitudes, which are uniquely hers. </p><br>

            <p><span class="bold">Hidden and unknown in the world.</span> This doesn’t mean that Marists retreat from the world. Rather, it means imitating Mary in her simple, gentle, and humble way by being fully engaged in life doing her work with no fanfare or desire to be noticed. It means doing the work that others will not or cannot do.</p><br>

            <p><span class="bold">To be instruments of Jesus’ Divine Mercy.</span> Marists accomplish this by helping to build a Church that is based on simplicity, humility, compassion, community, mercy and communion rather than through competition, control, power, bureaucracy, and complexity. Marists welcome all with the exclusion of no one helping to lead all to a life in union with God by doing the Father’s Will in all things with love for Him and for each other.</p><br>

            <p><span class="bold">The Disciple’s Disciple: Prayerful and Apostolic.</span> As Marists, we look to Mary as being the model disciple whose main focus was and is on her Son, Jesus. Mary was a quiet but strong pillar of strength and guidance for the early Church. The apostles and disciples looked to Mary as the New Eve – mother, woman, and follower of the Way. Her thoughts, like our thoughts, are on the building up of the Church for the salvation of her children. </p><br>

            <p><span class="bold">Tasting God.</span> Father Colin developed a term called, “Tasting God” as a metaphor for a deep experience with God. Through this experience we develop a disposition to put our trust in God in all things. As our experience with God continues and deepens we begin to be transformed by the Holy Spirit Who brings us in line with God’s priorities in our lives. We begin to gradually leave behind our priorities and schedules, our concerns and plans and open ourselves to God Who wishes to orient us and form us in the Word of God that that Jesus will take on flesh for our world.</p><br>

            <h3 class="heading-3">It means doing Mary's work...</h3>

            <p><span class="bold">Doing Mary’s Work.</span> As Marists, we are called to be missionaries even if it is within our own community. We are called to see people as part of our family with Mary as our mother. We are called to bring people to Jesus in Mary’s way, which is the way of gentleness, kindness, openness, mercy, compassion and excluding no one. We in essence become the presence of Mary in the world bringing her children back into the family of God.</p><br>

            <p><span class="bold">Nazareth and Pentecost.</span> These are two important reference points in Marist spirituality. During Nazareth Jesus learned at the feet of Mary and Joseph. Their house was a place of peace, love, and family. As Jesus grew, Mary observed what He did and said and kept all those things in her heart. For Marists, we place ourselves in Mary’s home in Nazareth and sit at her and Joseph’s feet learning from them how to love and how to be family. It is a place we can go as often as we like to grow in our spiritual life and helps to form us in our faith in stillness and tranquility in the presence of the Holy Spirit.</p><br>

            <p>During Pentecost when the Holy Spirit descended on Mary and the first believers the Church was born. Having the Holy Spirit overshadowing them, they proclaimed the mighty acts of God as a powerful witness to Jesus’ resurrection and His promise of the Second Advocate. Mary supported the Church in its infancy and helped it to grow.</p><br>
